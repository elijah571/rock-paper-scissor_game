This is mini projec, built to test my javascript knowledge after watching taking a course in javascript. 
I built a rock, paper and scissors game. 
How to play, when you click on th rock, paper or scissors.
The computer generate a random number and compare as computer move. it to the player move.
it then check if it's a win, tie or loss.
The score is update in the page.
This project is built with htm, css and majorly javasript.
The project came as a result of testing my knowledge, in javascript topics like:
variables, Math.random function, operators, conditional statement, function, object, DOM, eventLister, localStorage and Json.
How to play the game:
(1) click on one of the image to select a move, and the computer will randomly select a move also. The computer move will be compare with yours   and the result will be update.
(2) press th 'r; key to select "rock", 'p' to select "paper", 's' to select "scissor" and 'a' to "auto play".
